/**
 * <p>This package holds all "<b>D</b>ata <b>A</b>ccess <b>O</b>bjects" (<b>DAO</b>) for this application.</p>
 *
 * <p>Data Access Object is just a fancy name for a class that has only one purpose: to bring data from one point of the program to another. Therefore almost all internal DAOs are Java {@link java.lang.Record}s. DAOs used for a REST endpoint are normal POJOs. This is necessary to be able to set "example" values for OpenAPI 3.0.</p>
