/**
 * <p>This packet holds the service layer, which is called by the controller layer. It does the actual work and returns
 * any results back to the control layer.</p>
 * <p>The structure is simple: Basically, each controller has its own service. Accordingly, there is at least one
 * service class for each class in the {@link com.acme.onlineshop.controller} package.</p>
